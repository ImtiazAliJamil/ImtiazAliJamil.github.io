      <p>Hi, my name is James Grant, I’m a full stack web developer with over 8 years experience currently specialising in React development.
I am currently working for NatWest as a frontend software engineer on their comercial banking platform, Bankline.</p>

<p>I enjoy making clean and interactive UI that is quick and easy to use whilst also giving users an enjoyable experience.
I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work
with something new. The things that I currently have the most experience working with are:
<mark>ES6 Javascript</mark>,
<mark>React &amp; Redux</mark>,
<mark>Node.js</mark>,
<mark>Java</mark>,
<mark>PHP</mark>,

</p><p>This is a <mark>Jekyll</mark> theme that I have recently created, in fact it is what this resume has been built with.
I decided I wanted to learn how to create a fully open source project and thought that this would be the perfect project to do this with.
It has allowed me to share something I have created in a way that will be helpful for lots of people while also learning from this myself.</p>

I have used <mark>Docker</mark> to set up a development environment and <mark>Heroku</mark> to deploy and host the site. I have
a suite of unit and API tests for the backend and unit tests for the front end.</p>

<p>I have been using this project as a way to increase many of my skills and also learn new things. I have particually
enjoyed managing my own project and designing my own architecture and implementing this to a high standard.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-3 col-print-12 details"><h4>NatWest</h4><p><b>Software Engineer</b></p><p>August 2017 - Present</p></div>
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-print-12"><p>I am currently working at NatWest as a front end engineer focusing mostly on a corporate banking product called Bankline.
Working as part of a scrum team consiting of 5 developers, 2 testers and a PO/BA I have the oportunity to help drive the team forwards and
work with the PO defining what we are building.</p>

<p>I spend most of my time working on a specifc area of a large application that our team take ownership over. The front end is a <mark>React</mark> app
that talks to an API built using a collection of <mark>Java</mark> microservices. I have spent time working in multiple parts of the stack including
helping to define our front end architecure to follow best practices to implementing PDF and CSV export in a microservice.</p>

<p>Last year I took the lead on rebuilding the login journey to our application. I worked with the architects and designers to create something that would
be fit for purpose and be easy to maintain for years to come. I then built this to a high standard which lead to a seamless switch over from the previous
system with no issues. More recently I have acted as a consultant to external teams and application architects to advise on how we should be building new
functionality within our application. I have also built reusable components to the same standards as opensource libraries which have been used by different teams across the bank.</p>

<p>I enjoy learning about all areas of our application which allows me to be a go-to person for knowledge and queries within my team and the other teams
in the office. I am always looking to suggest improvements and challenge what and how we are working to make sure we are delivering the best service
to the customers while also developing to the highest standards.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-print-12"><p>During my time at Simitive I worked as part of an agile team building our own in house web based software and
also a large scale website for an international client. I gained experience working with a continuous integration
workflow using tools such as <mark>Jenkins</mark> and working with Amazon Web Services for deployments. We built most
of our software using <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Backbone</mark>, <mark>Marionette</mark>, <mark>Vue</mark> and <mark>Vuex</mark>.</p>

<p>For 6 months I was working on delivering a standalone web product for an international client that services over
600,000 users. This has been built from the ground up using <mark>Symfony</mark> to provide a backend API and
<mark>Backbone</mark> for the front end. I also gained a lot of experience with <mark>Elasticsearch</mark> to provide
search functionality of millions of entities to the front end. During the project I spent time out of hours
communicating with the client, performing deployments and providing support.</p>

<p>Towards the end of my time at Simitive my role involved assisting with the company’s devOps, this included managing
our <mark>AWS</mark> infrastructure as well as deploying and migrating sites. I also spent time configuring and maintaining
our clients SSO, this mostly involves configuring new clients who are using <mark>AD FS</mark>, <mark>Shibboleth</mark> and
<mark>CAS</mark> but also maintaining our software’s SSO functionality.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-print-12"><p>While working at Nudge I was able to work on a large number of projects ranging from small Drupal sites to large
enterprise level applications. I enjoy being able to work with clients to understand and surpass their expectations.
At Nudge I was also given the oppertunity to work with all of my core skills and to gain new skills in things
such as <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Angular</mark> and <mark>Gulp</mark>. I also worked on a number of <mark>iOS</mark> and
<mark>Android</mark> applications.</p>

<p>During my time at Nudge I was able to help the lead developer with the writing of Technical Specifications and
also Project Requirements. I feel this is a useful skill to have as it helps me to become an even more well-rounded
developer.</p>

<p>During the summer I had the opportunity to head to Accra, Ghana and work with the team out there. This was a
great opportunity to learn more about the industry in another country but also to allow me to lead their
team for a few weeks and gain lots of experience of remote teams.</p>

<mark>Drupal</mark>, <mark>Magento</mark>, <mark>Bootstrap</mark>, <mark>Codeigniter</mark>, <mark>Android</mark> and <mark>iOS</mark>.</p>

the drive to always want to try new tools and frameworks.</p>

we mainly focused on software development and the principles of programming I use a lot of these skills to
my advantage in my day to day work.</p>

<p>While at Bristol Uni I spent a lot of my free time with the Kitesurfing society. I spent 3 years on the committee
as a secretary, trip rep and then media and promotions manager. During this time I took on roles from organising
transport and designing posters to organising a trip to Portugal for over 30 students.</p>

  <div class="row clearfix">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <p>When I’m not sat at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. I do a lot a sports such as
mountain biking, road cycling, kitesuring and horse riding as well as trying to make time for things like
rock climbing and playing some rugby. Since my time at university I have become a very keen Kitesurfer and freestyle
Landboarder. In 2014 I competed and won the amateur landboard British powerkite tour.</p>

<p>I’m interested in photography and videography as I like to be creative, this is mainly through sport but
I enjoy landscape and abstract photography too. I like to showcase my work on instagram if
you would like to take a look - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jameswgrant/">jameswgrant</a>.</p>

<p>Finally during the rest of my free time you will either find me working on my bikes, rock climbing at one of
Bristol’s indoor climbing centres or down the Rec supporting Bath Rugby.</p>
